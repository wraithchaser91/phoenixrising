    <h2>How does it work</h2>
    <p>
        All money to play the games in the app is handled completely offline. You will use PPPoints in the app to play your preferred game of choice. Each point you have is worth 
        Â£1 and to get points you transfer money to the Club manager who then gives you the corresponding amount of points.

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
        Once you have downloaded the app on your preferred device you need to change your profile name so that it meets our Clubs rules. 
        You will need to choose a nickname that makes you recognisable to the other players, this could be your own name or a nickname 
        that you are well known by. We feel strongly that by having the Club set up this way that we can keep the offline vibe alive even while playing virtually.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please be aware that you can only change your name ONCE for free. If you make a mistake or need to change it again then it will unfortunately cost you diamonds, the apps in game premium currency.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you are ready to join and play against your friends then search for the Club by clicking on the magnifying glass on the home page. It will ask you for a Club ID. 
        Use 1786642 and make sure you type your 'real name' into the verification information when prompted. This will help us identify who you are when transferring PPPoints to you.
